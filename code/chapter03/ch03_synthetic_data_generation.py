Step-by-step walkthrough of the complete synthetic data generation pipeline:
  Step 1 — Load seed examples from Financial PhraseBank (HuggingFace)
  Step 2 — Build a category-controlled generation prompt with style anchoring
  Step 3 — Call a teacher LLM (Claude) to generate candidate examples
  Step 4 — Apply the LLM-as-judge quality gate (fidelity, format, domain safety)
  Step 5 — Check distribution alignment between synthetic and real data
  Step 6 — Mix with real data at the 30% synthetic cap and save with a manifest

Each step is self-contained. You can run the full file or import individual
functions to understand how each stage of the pipeline works.

# sees these and imitates their style, vocabulary, and level of detail.
#
# WITHOUT style anchoring: the teacher generates technically correct financial
# text but in its own preferred style, which may differ significantly from
# your real data. The model you train on it will learn the teacher's style
# rather than your domain's style.
#
# WITH style anchoring: the teacher generates text that looks like it came
# from the same source as your seeds. Distribution alignment (Step 5) will
# score much higher, and the trained model will match production inputs better.
#
# Category control prevents the teacher from overrepresenting the most common
# scenario. Without it, every generation call produces mostly neutral sentiment
# (the majority class) and very few negative examples (the minority class).
