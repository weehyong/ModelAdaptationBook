# Fix Safety Regression: Retrain with r=8 and Compare Results
#
# This script demonstrates how to fix safety regression by retraining with a
# smaller LoRA rank (r=8 instead of r=16), which preserves more base model behavior.
#
# Total time: ~20-30 minutes on single GPU
# - Training: 15-20 minutes
# - Evaluation: 5-10 minutes
