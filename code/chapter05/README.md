# Chapter 5 - LoRA and QLoRA Fine-Tuning (Qwen3-4B)

This chapter demonstrates parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA and QLoRA on **`Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507`**. You'll learn how to fine-tune a model, evaluate improvements, check for safety regression, and use adapters for inference.

**Repository**: <https://github.com/bahree/ModelAdaptationBook>

### Where is the code?

All Chapter 5 code is in **this folder** (`code/chapter05/`):

| Location | What you'll find |
|----------|------------------|
| **`scripts/`** | Scripts you run (prepare dataset, evaluate, validate). |
| **`*.py`** (this folder) | Python package (training, eval, modeling). Run as `python -m chapter05.train_lora` etc. |
| **`data/`** | Data files and golden sets. |

Shared utilities (JSONL, env, seed) live in **`code/common/`**. Install from `code/` with `pip install -e .`.

**Chapter outline and listing map:**

| Listing | In the chapter | In the repo |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **5.2** | Data format; prepare dataset | `scripts/listing_5_2_prepare_dataset.py` |
| **5.3** | LoRA config + SFTTrainer | `modeling.py`, `train_lora.py` |
| **5.4** | Evaluation | `scripts/listing_5_4_evaluate.py` |
| **5.5** | Inference with adapter | `generate.py` |
| **5.6** | QLoRA 4-bit loading | `train_qlora.py` |
| **5.7** | Safety regression test | `scripts/listing_5_4_evaluate.py` (safety section) |

**Data folder (`data/`):** Dolly 15K is on Hugging Face (`databricks/databricks-dolly-15k`). Create a local subset with `listing_5_2_prepare_dataset.py --out chapter05/data/dolly_subset`. The repo includes `golden/` (small test files for eval) and `smoke/` (minimal train/valid for `validate_chapter05.py`).

**What are `data.py` and `dataset.py`?**  
- **`data.py`** - Loads chat JSONL (Dolly or messages format) into `ChatExample` objects; used by training and eval to read your train/valid/test files.  
- **`dataset.py`** - Turns those examples into the format SFTTrainer needs (`prepare_dataset_for_sft`) or into tokenized batches for loss evaluation (`encode_examples`). Both are core to the chapter flow, not legacy.

## What We're Fine-Tuning

We're fine-tuning Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to improve **instruction-following quality** across diverse tasks. The base model is already instruction-tuned; the chapter demonstrates that even a 400-example LoRA pass produces measurable, category-dependent improvements.

**What we measure:**
- **Token-F1** (the primary metric for chapters 5 through 8): word-level overlap between the model's response and the reference, scored 0 to 1.
- **Per-category Token-F1**: breakdown across the 8 Dolly categories (open QA, general QA, closed QA, creative writing, brainstorming, classification, summarization, information extraction).
- **Safety refusal rate**: fraction of red-team prompts the model declines to answer; watched for regression after fine-tuning.

**Expected results** (representative measured values on the chapter's 400 / 50 / 50 Dolly split with `seed=42`; your numbers will move within ±0.02 across hardware and library versions):

- Base Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507: Token-F1 ≈ 0.212, safety refusal 100%.
- After LoRA (r=16, 3 epochs): Token-F1 ≈ 0.345 (+0.13), safety refusal can drop substantially (-40 to -80 pp in our measurements).
- After QLoRA (r=8, 3 epochs): Token-F1 ≈ 0.39, safety refusal ≈ 40-60%.

The safety regression on the broader Dolly subset is real and load-bearing for the chapter — it motivates the safety-regression suite that follows the eval and previews the safety conversation in chapter 6 and chapter 8.

## Why Dolly 15K?

We use **`databricks/databricks-dolly-15k`** because:

1. **Narrative continuity.** Chapter 4 uses Dolly 15K for few-shot prompting (no training). Chapter 5 uses the same dataset for LoRA fine-tuning, showing the progression from prompting to training on the same data. Chapter 6 reuses it for full SFT on a technical-support subset.
2. **Real public dataset.** Dolly 15K is widely used and commercially viable (CC-BY-SA-3.0). Human-authored, not synthetic.
3. **Measurable tasks.** Eight distinct categories with enough examples in each to surface per-category effects.
4. **Right size for LoRA.** A 400-example training set is the sweet spot: enough to show improvement, small enough to run end to end in ~10-15 minutes on a single consumer GPU.

## Prerequisites

### One-Time Setup (Fresh Machine)

**First-time setup:** If you haven't set up the book environment yet, follow the detailed instructions in **`code/README.md`** (one directory up). This includes:
- Checking Python version (**3.10+ required**)
- Installing system prerequisites (Ubuntu/Debian: `python3-venv`)
- Creating virtual environment
- Installing PyTorch (CPU or CUDA)
- Installing the book package

Once you've completed the general setup, come back here for Chapter 5-specific steps.

**Required for Chapter 5's QLoRA branch (Step 5) — install with the QLoRA extra.** The LoRA pass (Steps 1-4) works on the base `pip install -e ".[dev]"` install; QLoRA needs bitsandbytes for 4-bit quantization. From the `code/` directory:

```bash
pip install -e ".[qlora]"
```

QLoRA is optional. If you do not plan to run Step 5, you can skip this extra.

### Verify Your Setup (Recommended)

Before investing time in full training runs, validate that everything is installed correctly:

```bash
python chapter05/scripts/validate_chapter05.py
```

**What this does:**
1. **Checks** Python version
2. **Verifies** required data files exist (smoke test datasets, safety prompts)
3. **Confirms** PyTorch is installed and detects CUDA availability
4. **Runs** a tiny 2-step LoRA training (smoke test) to ensure the full pipeline works
5. **Validates** the adapter was created successfully

**Why run this?**
- **Catches setup issues early** - Better to find missing dependencies now than 15 minutes into a full training run
- **Tests the complete workflow** - Loads model, tokenizes data, runs training, saves adapter
- **Takes only 2-3 minutes** - Much faster than debugging a failed full training run
- **GPU-aware** - Skips training test if no GPU detected (to avoid slow CPU runs)
- **Chapter-specific** - Each chapter has its own validation script tailored to its requirements (other chapters may have different dependencies or model sizes)

**Expected output:**
```
Chapter 5 validation
- Python: 3.12.3
- Datasets: **OK**
- Torch: 2.10.0+cu126
- CUDA available: True
- Running tiny LoRA smoke training...
  [Progress bars and training logs]
- Smoke training: **OK** (adapter written to chapter05/runs/validate_lora_smoke)
```

**If validation fails**, it will show a clear error message indicating what's missing (e.g., "PyTorch not installed" or "Missing required files").

### GPU Requirements

- **LoRA**: minimum **8 GB VRAM** (RTX 3060 / 4060 class).
- **QLoRA**: minimum **6 GB VRAM** (works on smaller GPUs).
- **Recommended**: **12 GB+ VRAM** (RTX 4070 / 4080, NVIDIA A30, A100) for faster training.
- **Training time on a single A30**: ~10-12 minutes for LoRA, ~14 minutes for QLoRA (400 examples, 3 epochs). On smaller GPUs allocate up to 25-35 minutes.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

**Run all commands below from the `code/` directory with your virtual environment activated.** If you reopened the terminal or reconnected via SSH, activate the venv first (this is a common cause of "No module named 'chapter05'"):

```bash
cd /path/to/ModelAdaptationBook/code
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
# Windows:  .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 1: Download and Prepare the Dataset

Download and prepare a subset of Dolly 15K:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# From the code/ directory (venv active)
python chapter05/scripts/listing_5_2_prepare_dataset.py \
  --out chapter05/data/dolly_subset \
  --seed 42 \
  --train 400 \
  --valid 50 \
  --test 50
```

**Windows (PowerShell/CMD):**
```powershell
python chapter05/scripts/listing_5_2_prepare_dataset.py ^
  --out chapter05/data/dolly_subset ^
  --seed 42 ^
  --train 400 ^
  --valid 50 ^
  --test 50
```

This will:
- Download Dolly 15K from Hugging Face (first run only)
- Filter examples by length (20-2000 characters)
- Create train/valid/test splits with seed=42 for reproducibility
- Convert to messages format compatible with SFTTrainer
- Save to `chapter05/data/dolly_subset/`

**Expected output:**
```
Loading Databricks Dolly 15K dataset...
Filtered to ~13880 examples (length 20-2000 chars)
Wrote Dolly 15K subset to: chapter05/data/dolly_subset
  - Train: 400 examples
  - Valid: 50 examples
  - Test: 50 examples
  - Categories: {'open_qa': 107, 'general_qa': 69, 'classification': 61, ...}
```

Dolly 15K has 8 task categories (`open_qa`, `general_qa`, `closed_qa`, `summarization`, `brainstorming`, `classification`, `information_extraction`, `creative_writing`); with `--seed 42 --train 400` the breakdown above is what you will see.

### Step 2: Train LoRA Adapter

Train a LoRA adapter using TRL's SFTTrainer:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
python -m chapter05.train_lora \
  --train chapter05/data/dolly_subset/train.jsonl \
  --valid chapter05/data/dolly_subset/valid.jsonl \
  --out chapter05/runs/dolly_lora
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
python -m chapter05.train_lora ^
  --train chapter05/data/dolly_subset/train.jsonl ^
  --valid chapter05/data/dolly_subset/valid.jsonl ^
  --out chapter05/runs/dolly_lora
```

**What happens:**
- Loads base model (Qwen3-4B)
- Creates LoRA config (r=16, alpha=32)
- Trains for **3 epochs** (**15-20 minutes** on RTX 4070)
- Saves adapter to `chapter05/runs/dolly_lora/`

**Expected output:**
```
Saved LoRA adapter to: **chapter05/runs/dolly_lora**
```

### Step 3: Evaluate LoRA vs Base Model

Compare the fine-tuned model to the base model:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
python chapter05/scripts/listing_5_4_evaluate.py \
  --base Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 \
  --adapter chapter05/runs/dolly_lora \
  --dolly_test chapter05/data/dolly_subset/test.jsonl
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
python chapter05/scripts/listing_5_4_evaluate.py ^
  --base Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 ^
  --adapter chapter05/runs/dolly_lora ^
  --dolly_test chapter05/data/dolly_subset/test.jsonl
```

**This generates:**
- `chapter05/runs/eval_report/report.json` - Detailed metrics
- `chapter05/runs/eval_report/report.md` - **Human-readable summary**

**What you'll see:**
- Overall accuracy improvement (e.g., 70% → 85%)
- Per-category improvements (which task types improved most)
- **Safety regression check** (ensures fine-tuning didn't break safety)

### Step 4: Run Inference with the Adapter

Generate text with the fine-tuned adapter. **Ensure you are in `code/` with the venv activated** (easy to forget after a new shell or SSH session):

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
cd /path/to/ModelAdaptationBook/code
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m chapter05.generate \
  --base Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 \
  --adapter chapter05/runs/dolly_lora \
  --prompt "Explain how photosynthesis works in simple terms."
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
cd C:\path\to\ModelAdaptationBook\code
.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m chapter05.generate ^
  --base Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 ^
  --adapter chapter05/runs/dolly_lora ^
  --prompt "Explain how photosynthesis works in simple terms."
```

**Side-by-side example:** A full example with the same prompt run on the base model and on the base + adapter (commands, outputs, and what to notice) is in [examples/example_inference_base_vs_adapter.md](examples/example_inference_base_vs_adapter.md). A screenshot of the terminal output is in [images/chap5-inference_base_vs_adapter.png](images/chap5-inference_base_vs_adapter.png)—useful for comparing base vs adapter at a glance.

### Step 5: QLoRA (optional step)

QLoRA uses 4-bit quantization, enabling training on smaller GPUs. (You already installed the `qlora` extra in the Chapter 5 prerequisites.)

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
python -m chapter05.train_qlora \
  --train chapter05/data/dolly_subset/train.jsonl \
  --valid chapter05/data/dolly_subset/valid.jsonl \
  --out chapter05/runs/dolly_qlora
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
python -m chapter05.train_qlora ^
  --train chapter05/data/dolly_subset/train.jsonl ^
  --valid chapter05/data/dolly_subset/valid.jsonl ^
  --out chapter05/runs/dolly_qlora
```

**Differences from LoRA:**
- Uses 4-bit quantization (bitsandbytes)
- Lower default rank (r=8 vs r=16)
- Slightly longer training time (25-35 minutes)
- Similar or slightly lower accuracy (~1-2% difference)

**Expected output:** Training logs show loss, learning rate, and mean token accuracy per step; at the end you'll see `Saved QLoRA adapter to: chapter05/runs/dolly_qlora`. For a full example log and an explanation of each line (including the tokenizer PAD message and HF warning), see [examples/example_qlora_training_output.md](examples/example_qlora_training_output.md).

To compare LoRA vs QLoRA after training both:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
python chapter05/scripts/listing_5_4_evaluate.py \
  --base Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 \
  --adapter chapter05/runs/dolly_lora \
  --adapter_alt chapter05/runs/dolly_qlora \
  --dolly_test chapter05/data/dolly_subset/test.jsonl
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
python chapter05/scripts/listing_5_4_evaluate.py ^
  --base Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 ^
  --adapter chapter05/runs/dolly_lora ^
  --adapter_alt chapter05/runs/dolly_qlora ^
  --dolly_test chapter05/data/dolly_subset/test.jsonl
```

**Expected output:** Steps 1–4 run for the base and LoRA adapter; then the script loads and evaluates the alternative adapter (QLoRA) and writes one report comparing all three. For a full example log and explanation of each step, see [examples/example_qlora_evaluation_output.md](examples/example_qlora_evaluation_output.md).

**What you'll see:**
```
Step 1/4: Loading base model...
**[OK]** Base model loaded

Step 2/4: Evaluating base model...
Evaluating examples... ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 50/50
Running safety checks... ━━━━━━━━━━━━ 10/10
**[OK]** Base evaluation complete

Step 3/4: Loading adapter from chapter05/runs/dolly_lora...
**[OK]** Adapter loaded

Step 4/4: Evaluating fine-tuned model...

**[OK] Evaluation complete!**
**[OK]** JSON report: chapter05/runs/eval_report/report.json
**[OK]** Markdown summary: chapter05/runs/eval_report/report.md
```

Evaluation takes **5-10 minutes** total on a single GPU. The progress bars show exactly what's happening at each stage.

## Understanding the Results

### Evaluation Metrics

The evaluation script measures:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Exact Match (EM)** | Percentage of responses that exactly match the reference (after normalization) |
| **Token F1** | Token-level F1 score (measures partial correctness) |

**Per-category metrics** (accuracy broken down by task type):

| Category | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `open_qa` | Open-ended questions |
| `closed_qa` | Factual questions with specific answers |
| `creative_writing` | Creative tasks |
| `brainstorming` | Idea generation |
| `classification` | Categorization tasks |
| `summarization` | Text summarization |
| `information_extraction` | Extracting structured info |

### Expected Results

With only 400 training examples, absolute scores are modest. Focus on **deltas** vs the base model.

**Base Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507** (the floor):
- Overall exact match: 0%
- Overall Token-F1: 0.21
- Safety refusal rate: 100% (well-aligned base)

**After LoRA (r=16, 3 epochs, 400 examples)** — representative measured numbers (your run will vary within ±0.02 on F1 across hardware and library versions):
- Overall exact match: 0%
- **Overall Token-F1: ~0.34-0.39** (Δ +0.13 to +0.18)
- **Safety refusal rate: 20-60%** (Δ −40 to −80 pp — see the warning below)
- Per-category: strong gains in classification (+0.48 F1) and summarization (+0.29 F1); modest on open QA (+0.15); small or negative on creative writing and brainstorming.

**The safety regression is real.** On our validated 2026-05-09 run, the LoRA adapter dropped the safety-refusal rate from 100% to 20% on a 10-prompt red-team set — the adapter answers 8 of 10 prompts the base model correctly refuses. The chapter's safety-regression suite catches this; the fix is to either (a) keep a smaller LoRA rank such as `r=8`, (b) add explicit refusal examples to the training data, or (c) follow with a preference-optimisation pass (chapter 8) to re-instill the alignment.

**For higher absolute scores:** scale to 1,000-2,000 training examples. Expect Token-F1 in the 0.50-0.70 range and EM in the 15-35% range, at proportionally longer training time.

**→ See [examples/README_INTERPRETING_RESULTS.md](examples/README_INTERPRETING_RESULTS.md) for detailed guidance on understanding your results.** For a full example of a report comparing base, LoRA, and QLoRA (with section-by-section interpretation), see [examples/example_eval_report_lora_vs_qlora.md](examples/example_eval_report_lora_vs_qlora.md).

**Why We See Improvement:**
- Base model is general-purpose; fine-tuning adapts it to the specific instruction style and task distribution in Dolly
- With small datasets (400 examples), models specialize but may show mixed results across categories
- LoRA learns to better follow the instruction format and response patterns
- 400 examples is enough to show clear improvement without overfitting

### Safety Regression Check

The evaluation also runs a safety suite to ensure fine-tuning didn't weaken safety guardrails. You should see:
- **Refusal rate:** Similar or slightly higher than base model
- **If refusal rate drops significantly**, that's a red flag-the adapter may need more safety examples

## Troubleshooting

### **"No module named 'chapter05'"**
- **Cause:** The shell is not using the virtual environment, or you're not in the `code/` directory. Common after reopening a terminal or reconnecting via SSH.
- **Fix:** From the repo root, go to `code/`, activate the venv, then run your command:
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/ModelAdaptationBook/code
  source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
  # Windows:  .venv\Scripts\activate
  python -m chapter05.generate --base Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 --prompt "Your prompt"
  ```
- If you never created a venv here, follow **Prerequisites** in this README and in `code/README.md`.

### **"CUDA out of memory"**
- Reduce `--batch_size` (default: 1)
- Increase `--grad_accum` to maintain effective batch size
- Use **QLoRA instead of LoRA** (lower memory)

### **"Dataset not found"**
- **Run `listing_5_2_prepare_dataset.py` first** (Step 1)
- Check that files exist: `chapter05/data/dolly_subset/train.jsonl`

### "TRL not installed"
- Install: `pip install trl>=0.9.0`
- Or reinstall: `pip install -e "."` (should include trl from pyproject.toml)

### Training is slow
- Check GPU is being used: `nvidia-smi` should show Python process
- Reduce `--max_length` if using very long sequences
- Use QLoRA for faster training on some GPUs

## Testing on Another Machine

On a fresh clone, follow **Prerequisites** (above) then **Step-by-Step Instructions** (Steps 1-3: prepare data, train, evaluate). With the same data and seed (42), results should match within **2-3%** across machines.

## Advanced: Multi-LoRA

Train multiple adapters for different purposes:

```bash
# Train adapter A
python -m chapter05.train_lora --train data_a.jsonl --out runs/adapter_a ...

# Train adapter B  
python -m chapter05.train_lora --train data_b.jsonl --out runs/adapter_b ...

# Compare at inference (Linux/macOS)
python -m chapter05.multi_lora_demo \
  --adapter_a chapter05/runs/adapter_a \
  --adapter_b chapter05/runs/adapter_b \
  --prompt "Your prompt here"

# Windows
python -m chapter05.multi_lora_demo ^
  --adapter_a chapter05/runs/adapter_a ^
  --adapter_b chapter05/runs/adapter_b ^
  --prompt "Your prompt here"
```

## Publishing Adapters (Optional)

Publish your adapter to Hugging Face Hub. First, authenticate once (the token is cached at `~/.cache/huggingface/token` and reused by future commands):

```bash
huggingface-cli login
# paste a token with "write" scope from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
# answer "n" to the git credentials prompt
```

The publish command picks the cached token up automatically; `HF_TOKEN` env var and `--hf_token` flag are also supported.

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
python chapter05/scripts/publish_adapter.py \
  --adapter chapter05/runs/dolly_lora \
  --repo_id <your-username>/qwen3-4b-dolly-lora \
  --private \
  --dataset_manifest chapter05/data/dolly_subset/manifest.json \
  --eval_report chapter05/runs/eval_report/report.json
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
python chapter05/scripts/publish_adapter.py ^
  --adapter chapter05/runs/dolly_lora ^
  --repo_id <your-username>/qwen3-4b-dolly-lora ^
  --private ^
  --dataset_manifest chapter05/data/dolly_subset/manifest.json ^
  --eval_report chapter05/runs/eval_report/report.json
```

## Running Tests

Chapter 5 includes unit tests for data processing and metrics:

```bash
# From code/ directory
pytest chapter05/tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest chapter05/tests/test_metrics.py
pytest chapter05/tests/test_data_normalization.py
```

**What the tests cover:**
- `test_metrics.py` - Tests for exact match and token F1 metrics
- `test_data_normalization.py` - Tests for data format conversions

To install test dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"  # Includes pytest, ruff
```

## Troubleshooting

### "The tokenizer has new PAD/BOS/EOS tokens" Warning

During training (Step 2), you may see:
```
The tokenizer has new PAD/BOS/EOS tokens that differ from the model config and generation config. 
The model config and generation config were aligned accordingly, being updated with the tokenizer's values. 
Updated tokens: {'bos_token_id': None, 'pad_token_id': 151643}.
```

**This is expected and harmless.** Here's why:

- Qwen models don't ship with a dedicated PAD token
- Our code sets `pad_token = eos_token` (standard practice for Qwen)
- TRL's SFTTrainer detects this and updates the model config to match
- Training proceeds normally and produces valid adapters

**No action needed.** Your model will train and generate text correctly.

**Technical note:** Using EOS as PAD is the standard approach for Qwen models. The base model is already instruction-tuned and knows when to stop generating, so this doesn't affect generation quality in practice.

## W&B (Optional, Non-Fatal)

Enable experiment tracking:

```bash
pip install -e ".[wandb]"
setx BOOKCODE_REPORT_TO wandb  # Windows
export BOOKCODE_REPORT_TO=wandb  # macOS/Linux
```

Disable if not needed:
```bash
setx WANDB_DISABLED true  # Windows
export WANDB_DISABLED=true  # macOS/Linux
```
